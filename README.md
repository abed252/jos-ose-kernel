# JOS Operating System — OSE Labs (Technion)

Educational x86 operating system developed as part of the  
**Operating Systems Engineering (OSE)** course.

This repository contains my completed implementation of Labs 1–6
based on the MIT JOS teaching OS, including memory management,
process abstraction, scheduling, file system, and networking.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- x86 boot process & protected mode
- Kernel initialization
- Physical page allocator
- Virtual memory & paging
- User environments (process abstraction)
- System calls
- Preemptive multitasking
- File system
- Basic networking stack

## 🧠 High-Level Architecture

Bootloader  
→ Kernel Entry (protected mode)  
→ Memory Management (paging, allocator)  
→ Environment / Process Management  
→ System Calls & Traps  
→ File System & Networking
